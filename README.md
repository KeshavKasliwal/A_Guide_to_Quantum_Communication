<h1 align="center">A Guide to Quantum Communication</h1>

Hey everyone! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

During my internship at Space Applications Centre, ISRO, I found that the resources in Quantum Communication are not that accessible as compared to what we have for other well-known topics such as Machine Learning.

The only resource that we have is by reading research papers that are difficult to understand at first which isn't appealing to a lot of people. To eradicate this problem, I created this repository. 

One of the main reasons to create this is to share the MATLAB codes used to observe the behaviour of the parameters of certain Quantum Key Distribution Protocols such as Secure Key Rate, QBER, Mean Photon Number and many more. The repository also contains the reference papers that I've made use of in order to complete this. 

However, I'll be updating this repository with other implementations related to the field of Quantum Communication to make this a dependable source for everyone.

Also, for people who are exploring Quantum Communication for the first time, here are some links that could help you get a great start in this.
